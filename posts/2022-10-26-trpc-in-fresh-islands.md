Inspired by the [TRPC](https://trpc.io/) usage in [Create-T3-App](https://create.t3.gg/), I wondered how this awesome package could be utilized in Island Components in the Deno 'Fresh' Framework. 
To distinquish the framework 'Fresh' from the word 'fresh', I will write it from now on with a capital F. 

## TL;DR 

You can look directly at my example repo here: https://github.com/jbscratch/trpc10-in-fresh/  
 
It is also hosted at: https://trpc10-in-fresh.deno.dev/

(The surface is not very exciting, it simply prints "Hello World". But under the hood it's very cool, whcih is why I'm writing this blogpost!)

For the eager amongst you, here are the basic ingredients for integrating TRPC with Fresh Islands. 
However, keep in mind, that these steps need some adjustments to run in deno and fresh: 

- 1 Standard TRPC Setup, adjusted to use with Deno: https://trpc.io/docs/v10/quickstart  
- 2 With TRPC `fetch` adapter, originally developed for Cloudflare Workers: https://trpc.io/docs/v10/fetch  
- 3 Create a new Fresh Route file for TRPC under `routes` with a file named `/routes/trpc/[...path].ts`;   
- 4 Add a Fresh Route Handler for GET and POST inside the TRPC route file as described here:  
   https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started/custom-handlers  

For an exact description of the journey I took, go to this Github Discussion:

Or, simply finish reading this post to learn exactly, how this can be implemented! ðŸ˜‰

## The Parts 

### TRPC 
If you need a quick refresher, what TRPC is doing and why it is awesome, 
watch this Youtube Short by Ben Holmes ([@BHolmesDev on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BHolmesDev)):

## Fresh 

[Fresh](fresh.deno.dev) is a frontend framework for [Deno](deno.land), which ships zero js per default to the client and provides a way to have interactive 'islands' components on the clients. 
These island components are preact components, and by shipping only the needed js to the client, 
the loading times are cut to a minimum. 

Furthermore, Fresh Apps are fully written in Typescript and mostly server rendered. This makes it a great fit for TRPC, which has the biggest impact when server and client are both written in Typescript. 
It also helps a lot that Deno can run Typescript directly and out of the box, which makes the integration feel great!

## The Integration 

### The TRPC Router in `server.ts` 

To connect to an API, we first have to define it! 
Therefore start by creating a `src/trpc` folder inside your Fresh repo and add a `server.ts` file to it. 
You should not put this file somewhere below the `routes` folder of fresh, because the files inside will not render as routes.  

This file is very similar to the one the TRPC Tutorials, but because it needs a special extra for this integration, we'll go through it again.
Note, that I'm using TRPC V10 here, since it is mostly stable and will be final soon. 

First, here is the whole file: 

```ts
import { initTRPC } from "@trpc/server";
import { Context } from "./fetch-context.ts";
import { z } from "zod";

const t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();

// This export is needed for integrating TRPC with Fresh in `/routes/trpc`
// It is only used on the server!
export const appRouter = t.router({
  hello: t.procedure
    .input(z.string())
    .query((req) => {
      return `Hello ${req.input}`;
    }),
});

// This export only export the *type signature* of the trpc router!
// This avoids accidentally importing the full Router into client-side code
export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;

```

### What is this `Context`?

We see, that the first import is initTRPC, like in the TRPC tutorials.  
But in the second line, we need something extra. 
This imports a `Context` type which is defined in the `./fetch-context.ts` in the `src/trpc` folder: 

```ts
import { inferAsyncReturnType } from "@trpc/server";
import { FetchCreateContextFnOptions } from "@trpc/server/adapters/fetch";

export function createContext({ req }: FetchCreateContextFnOptions) {
  return { req };
}

export type Context = inferAsyncReturnType<typeof createContext>;

```

But what exactly is that `Context` now?  
When we go into the [TRPC docs for the TRPC fetch-integration](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/fetch#create-the-context) (which we are using), we see the following: 

> Then you need a context that will be created for each request.

This basically means, TRPC allows us to enrich the context which is passed to each api handler with extra information per request!
Since their example is for running TRPC in Cloudflare Workers, their `createContext` Example looks like this: 

```ts
export function createContext({ req }: FetchCreateContextFnOptions) {
  const user = { name: req.headers.get('username') ?? 'anonymous' };
  return { req, user };
}
```

**But we don't need that functionality today, so we simply pass the request down to the TRPC handlers without changes.**
