Since the new hottnes on the block is typesafe apis from backend to frontend, I wondered how this could be integrated into 

## TL;DR 

For the eager amongst you, here are the basic ingredients for integrating TRPC with Fresh Islands: 

1. Standard TRPC Setup, adjusted to use with deno: https://trpc.io/docs/v10/quickstart
2. With TRPC `fetch` adapter, originally developed for Cloudflare Workers: https://trpc.io/docs/v10/fetch
3. Create a new Fresh Route file for TRPC under `routes` with a file named `/routes/trpc/[...path].ts`; 
4. Add a Fresh Route Handler for GET and POST inside the trpc route file as described here:
