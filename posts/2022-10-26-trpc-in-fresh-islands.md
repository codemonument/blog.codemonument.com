Inspired by the [TRPC](https://trpc.io/) usage in [Create-T3-App](https://create.t3.gg/), I wondered how this awesome package could be utilized in Island Components in the Deno 'Fresh' Framework. To distinquish the framework 'Fresh' from the word 'fresh', I will write it from now on with a capital F. 

If you need a quick refresher, what TRPC is doing and why it is awesome,

## TL;DR 

For the eager amongst you, here are the basic ingredients for integrating TRPC with Fresh Islands: 

1. Standard TRPC Setup, adjusted to use with deno: https://trpc.io/docs/v10/quickstart
2. With TRPC `fetch` adapter, originally developed for Cloudflare Workers: https://trpc.io/docs/v10/fetch
3. Create a new Fresh Route file for TRPC under `routes` with a file named `/routes/trpc/[...path].ts`; 
4. Add a Fresh Route Handler for GET and POST inside the trpc route file as described here:
